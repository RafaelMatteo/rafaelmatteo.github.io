                Hello! I am Rafael...
            </h2>
            <p>
                Passionate about Data Analysis, Data Science and Machine Learning with a strong focus on developing 
                analytical skills and problem solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a background in Software Development, my curiosity and desire to learn led me to learn 
                about Data Science and, through it, to learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning, 
                disciplines that have captivated me; I have consolidated my experience working on various 
                projects that range from Exploratory Data Analysis to the implementation of advanced Machine 
                Learning models.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my career, I have cultivated solid skills in programming languages such as Python and 
                R, as well as efficient data management using tools such as Pandas and NumPy to TensorFlow 
                and Pytorch. <br>
                My focus on problem solving has been reflected in practical projects where I have applied 
                Machine Learning techniques to make informed decisions and improve decision-making processes.
